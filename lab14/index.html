        A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒŋ/;[1] US: /krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, /krəˈsɒnt/; French pronunciation: [kʁwa.sɑ̃] (About this sound listen))
        is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry named for its crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made
        of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
        then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar
        to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly
        since antiquity.[2] Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian and French bakeries and pâtisseries. In the late
        1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food which can
        be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissanterie was explicitly a French response to American-style fast food,[3]
        and as of 2008 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[4]
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in France.

    <p>
        A doughnut or donut (both: /ˈdoʊnət/ or /ˈdoʊnʌt/; see spelling differences) is a type of fried dough confectionery or dessert
        food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade
        or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. Doughnuts are usually deep
        fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or a number of shapes without a hole, and often filled,
        but can also be ball-shaped (the "hole"). Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings and flavorings
        are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening,
        eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.[1][2] The two most common types are the ring
        doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings.
        Alternatively, small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed
        with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with powdered sugar or sprinkles or fruit. Other
        shapes include rings, balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into
        cake (including the old-fashioned) and yeast-risen type doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee purchased
        at doughnut shops or fast food restaurants, but can also be paired with milk.

    <p>
        Brioche (/ˈbriːoʊʃ, -ɒʃ/; French: [bʁi.ɔʃ]) is a pastry of French origin that is similar to a highly enriched bread, and
        whose high egg and butter content (400 grams for each kilogram of flour) give it a rich and tender crumb. Chef Joel
        Robuchon describes it as "light and slightly puffy, more or less fine, according to the proportion of butter and
        eggs."[1] It has a dark, golden, and flaky crust, frequently accentuated by an egg wash applied after proofing. Brioche
        is considered a Viennoiserie, in that it is made in the same basic way as bread, but has the richer aspect of a pastry
        because of the extra addition of eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and, sometimes, brandy) and occasionally
        a bit of sugar. Brioche, along with pain au lait and pain aux raisins—which are commonly eaten at breakfast or as
        a snack—form a leavened subgroup of Viennoiserie. Brioche is often cooked with fruit or chocolate chips and served
        on its own, or as the basis of a dessert with many local variations in added ingredients, fillings or toppings.
