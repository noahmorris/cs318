    <h1>Polynomials</h1>
    <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Constant</dt>
        <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a.</dd>
        <dt>Linear</dt>
        <dd>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x + b.</dd>
        <dt>Quadratic</dt>
        <dd>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x&#178; + b &times; x + c.</dd>
        <dt>Cubic</dt>
        <dd>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x&#179; + b &times; x&#178; + c &times; x + d.</dd>
