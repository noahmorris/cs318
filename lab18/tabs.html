                A doughnut or donut (both: /ˈdoʊnət/ or /ˈdoʊnʌt/; see spelling differences) is a type of fried dough confectionery or dessert
                food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade
                or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. Doughnuts are usually deep
                fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or a number of shapes without a hole, and often filled,
                but can also be ball-shaped (the "hole"). Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings and flavorings
                are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening,
                eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.[1][2] The two most common types are the ring
                doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings.
                Alternatively, small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed
                with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with powdered sugar or sprinkles or fruit. Other
                shapes include rings, balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into
                cake (including the old-fashioned) and yeast-risen type doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee purchased
                at doughnut shops or fast food restaurants, but can also be paired with milk.
