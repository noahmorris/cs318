Travel can be stressful, for a lot of reasons. But some stress can be preempted. Whenever you leave the house for more than a few days, you should do these things:
Turn off the water to all toilets. You never know what they'll do while you're gone.
Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste in your carry-on. If your suitcase gets lost, your mouth feels it first.
Clean everything, so that no one can enjoy it while you're gone.
